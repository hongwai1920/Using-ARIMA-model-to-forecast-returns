# Using ARIMA model to forecast returns
This repository contains a detailed theoretical and practical introduction to time series analysis models such as AutoRegressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). 

We also introduced and implemented several stationarity tests such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and KPSS.  
We use Python's library statsmodels to implement all models above and use the ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices.
