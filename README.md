# Using ARIMA model to forecast returns
This repository contains a detailed theoretical and practical application to time series analysis models such as AutoRegressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). 

As staionarity is important in using those time series mdodels, ee also introduced and implemented several stationarity tests such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and KPSS.  
We use Python's library statsmodels to implement all models above and use the ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices.

All datasets in csv are obtained from Yahoo Finance.

## 0. Introduction.ipynb
This notebook gives a flavour of how to use ARIMA to predict stock prices. 
The following is a plot of using ARIMA(5,2,0) to predict Apple'stock price with mean square error 1.640.

## 1. Simulations for Time Series Models.ipynb
This notebook introduces time series.
The following four time series are the open, high, low and close prices of Apple's stock.

## 2. White Noise.ipynb
This notebook introduces stochastic processes, autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of a stochastic process.
Lastly, we also discuss white noise stochastic process.
The following plots contain time series, histogram, ACF and PACF graphs of a white noise generated by standard normal distribution.

## 3. Stationary Time Series.ipynb
This notebook introduces stationarity, an important concept in time series analysis. 
We differentiate those time series which exhibit stationarity and those who do not by using stationarity tests such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF) and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests.
